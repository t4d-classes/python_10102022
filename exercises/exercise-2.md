# Exercise 2

1. Using the data types and structures we have learned thus far, capture a history of the calculator commands: add, subtract, multiple, divide

For each history entry, store a unique integer id (do not use external modules, just write some code to generate an id), the name of the command, and the operand value typed in. Do not track the result on the history.

2. Add a new command to the calculator named "history". When the user runs the "history" command display a history of the commands.

3. Add a new command to the calculator named "remove". When the user runs the "remove" command, ask the user for a history entry id. Then remove the history entry from the history list. Do not update the result.

4. When the "clear" command is executed, clear the history.
